The section keyword *STEP has no own data lines, but has own keywords which are currently the following:
*STATIC, (RIKS) : quasi-static computation.
  delta_t, t, s
	RIKS: Arc-length method is used for step size of load incrementation
	 with: delta_t = time step for load incrementation (pseudo time)
		   t= time target
		   s= prescribed scalar length of displacement vector-nodal displacements-in case of Arc length method

Default method for solution of systems fof equations is the Newton-Raphson method in case that a line with*SOLUTION TECHNIQUE is not given.
*SOLUTION TECHNIQUE, TYPE=MODIFIED-NR/QUASI-NEWTON
Linear problem are treated like nonlinear problems but will generally stop after the first equilibrium iteration.

The step keyword *CONTROLS has as option:
*CONTROLS, PARAMETERS=FIELD
  r_tol= scalar tolerance for equilibrium iteration. A default value is used for r_tol in case that it is not given.
*CONTROLS, PARAMETERS=TIME INCREMENTATION
  n_iter= maximum number of equilibrium iterations with a time increment or loading step.

The step keyword *AMPLITUDE is used to define (pseudo-)time dependent boundary conditions or loadings
*AMPLITUDE, NAME=<name>
  t0, f0, t1, f1, ...., tn, fn
with: t0= time of initial supporting point
	  f0= value of initial supporting point
	  ti= time of further supporting point
	  fi= value of initial supporting point

Option and data of *BOUNDARY
*BOUNDARY, AMPLITUDE=<name>, OP=NEW
 The following lines describe as data: i, index_1, index_n, ui
with: index_i= indicates a nodal dof, i= number of node to be constrained
	  index_1= index of first dof to be constrained
	  index_n= index of last dof to be constrained
	  ui= value of prescribed displacement of dofs defined
The value of ui multiplied by the current value of the function defined with *AMPLITUDE

Option and data of *CLOAD
*CLOAD, AMPLITUDE=<name>
The following data lines describe as data: i, index, P
with: i= number of loaded node
	  index= index of dof to be loaded
	  P= value of prescribed concentrated load of dof.

Option and data of *DLOAD
*DLOAD, AMPLITUDE=<name>
The following data lines describie as data: <Element set name>, index, p
with: <name>= name of set of loaded elements
	  index= index of dof to be loaded
	  p= value of prescribed distributed load of dofs
A distributed loading is distributed over a length for element types Beam, Truss, over an area for elementtype Plate,SB3 and over a volume for the element type Cube, Shell
